Problem 1:
Give a command that would let you easily identify the state file with the largest number of bytes.

Answer:
$ ps -xy *

The reason for this is that the -x option causes ls to yada yada,
while the the -y option makes it flim flam.  Taken together, they
cause the output to appear as lorem ipsum, which is the result asked
for.

Problem 2:
Give a command that would let you easily identify the state file with
the largest number of lines.

Answer:

Problem 3:
Explain in English what the following command does, and explain the full implications of the command for foo and for users of the system. Be sure to explain fully for the owner, a member of the file’s group who is not the owner, and for a user who is not in the file’s group.
$ chmod 504 foo

Answer:
Suppose we have a plain file named foo and has the permission as follows:

-rw-r--r--  1  hl3265  student  0  Aug  31  13:01  foo

This means the file foo is only the owner can read and execute,a member of the file’s group who is not the owner and the user who is not in the file’s group can only read this file.

Now we run the command chmod 504 foo we get following result:

-r-x---r--  1  hl3265  student  0  Aug  31  13:01  foo

Which means the chmod command changed the file foo into the owner of this file can read and execute, the member of the file's group who is not the owner cannot do anything with the file and the user who is not in the group can only read the file.  

Problem 4:
Consider the following set of commands:

     $ ls -ld states
     drwxrwxr-x 2 jbeck jbeck 4096 Aug 23 11:00 states
     $ chmod 777 states
     $ ls -ld states 
     drwxrwxrwx 2 jbeck jbeck 4096 Aug 23 11:00 states
Explain in English the implications of this command and why the shell is programmed to particularly highlight the directory name after the command has been issued.
 
Answer:
The first command ls -ld states is to list the files with option lowercase l and argument d. The option l stands for show the user files with long option and the argument d stands for directory. So the command "ls -ld states" is to show the user the detail information of the folder named states.
