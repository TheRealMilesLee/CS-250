Problem 1:
Give a command that would let you easily identify the state file with 
the largest number of bytes.

Answer:
$ wc -c *
The command wc is refer to word count, and the option -c  with 
argument * is to print the byte count of the state file.

Problem 2:
Give a command that would let you easily identify the state file with 
the largest number of lines.

Answer:
$wc -l *
The command wc is the word count, and the option -l with argument * 
is to print the newline count in state file.

Problem 3:
Explain in English what the following command does, and explain the full
implications of the command for foo and for users of the system. 
Be sure to explain fully for the owner, a member of the file’s group 
who is not the owner, and for a user who is not in the file’s group.
$ chmod 504 foo

Answer:
Suppose we have a plain file named foo and has the permission as follows:
-rw-r--r-- 1 hl3265 student 0 Aug 31 13:01 foo
This means the file foo is only the owner can read and execute,a member 
of the file’s group who is not the owner and the user who is not in the 
file’s group can only read this file.
Now we run the command chmod 504 foo we get following result:
-r-x---r-- 1 hl3265 student 0 Aug 31 13:01 foo
Which means the chmod command changed the file foo into the owner
of this file can read and execute, the member of the file's group 
who is not the owner cannot do anything with the file 
and the user who is not in the group can only read the file.  

Problem 4:
Consider the following set of commands:

     $ ls -ld states
     drwxrwxr-x 2 jbeck jbeck 4096 Aug 23 11:00 states
     $ chmod 777 states
     $ ls -ld states 
     drwxrwxrwx 2 jbeck jbeck 4096 Aug 23 11:00 states
Explain in English the implications of this command and why the shell is
programmed to particularly highlight the directory name after the command
has been issued.
 
Answer:
The first command is to list the information about directories with long
listing format and only list the file itself's information instead of the
file information that inside the directory. The second command is to set 
the file permission of the directory named states to read, write and execute 
for all the users including the owner of the file, a member of the file’s 
group who is not the owner, and for a user who is not in the file’s group.
And the reason why after the command ls -ld states has been issued again 
and the states highlight in the shell is because it has the execute permission 
now and the unix treated this as a executable file.

Problem 5:
Give a grep command that will find every city containing an uppercase C.

Answer:
$ grep -F C *
The reason for this is that the -F option causes grep to do a fast matching,
while the the C argument makes it matching the cities that containing uppercase C. Taken together, they cause the output to appear as cities containing an uppercase C, which is the result asked for.


Problem 6:
Give a grep command that will find every city beginning with uppercase C.

Answer:
$ grep '^C' *

The reason for this is that the '^C' argument causes grep to display cities that begin with 'C', while the the ^ matacharacter set the shell as "line begin", and uppercase C is the argument that ^ metacharacter takes. 
Taken together, they cause the output to appear as cities beginning with uppercase C, which is the result asked for.


Problem 7:
Give a grep command that will find every city in California that has an 
uppercase letter in a position that is not the beginning of the line.

Answer: 
$ grep -E '^.[A-Z]' California

Problem 8:
Give a grep command that will find every city in California that has a 
maximum of 6 contiguous lowercase letters.

Answer:
$ grep -E '[a-z][6]' California
